        </h1>
        <p>
          Ally for accessibility and inclusiveness. Applications should always
          be created and maintained for a comprehensive audience. Everyone
          should be invited! ðŸ¥³
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications should apply the best new technologies where they enhance
          maintainability and function. Angular and React are excellent tools,
          but the web is ultimately delivered as HTML, CSS, and plain
          JavaScript. Our job is to reduce complexity wherever we can.
        </p>

          Accenture, RBFCU, IBM, and USAA. He prefers Agile/SCRUM methodologies
          and diverse, expressive teams.
