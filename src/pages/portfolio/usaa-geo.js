          <p>
            When appropriating a “starter” stack from a company like ESRI, some
            features are built-in but require customizations and comfort with
            the coding best practices dictated by a new framework. My
            contributions included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Readable, maintainable and modular JavaScript. This was essential
              for an effort that likely would find its way to different
              development team over a period of years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy, intuitive design. Developing a comprehensive help
              documentation and retrofitting special user experience ehancements
              outside of ArcGIS and Dojo defaults.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="one-pt-1-rem font-weight-bold">Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            When you have a nationwide customer base of millions of homeowner’s
            insurance policies you can sometimes get only a myopic view from
            charts and spreadsheets. This project sought to do three things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Allow MSRs (Member Service Representatives) to select areas on a
              map and retreive all relevant homeowner policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow MSRs and executives to overlay weather, fire, and other maps
              and measure proximity to potentially catastrophic events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow MSRs to export emails and contact information for aggregate
              warnings or instructions to policy owners.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="one-pt-1-rem font-weight-bold">Technology Stack</h2>
          <p>
            We utilized services from ESRI, a company that builds and maintains
            a mapping and spatial analytics product called ArcGIS. Through their
            licensing, we were able to house a replica of our own confidential
            data on an in-house server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front-end part of the stack is built on Dojo Toolkit, an open-
            source modular JavaScript library. The stack incorporates modern
            ECMAScript features such as client-side storage for better memory
            management of large data-sets.
